  //Which method of article.js is interacting with this particular piece of `server.js`?

  //Answer: The fetch all method is connected to this section of code

  // this line says hey router, when the router asks for /articles, go to the model, and select EVERYTHING, then take the rows (ie all the article objects) from that 'select all' function and send them as the response, when 'app' ie 'express' ie the controller/router requests /articles.  Which is to say when something on the view, triggers a request for the URI '/articles'.
